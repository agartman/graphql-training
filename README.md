# Step1: Hello world

In this step, you'll start this series of hands-on coding lab on GraphQL.

Step one will get you started and we'll go through the components in this code base:

* Express server
* GraphQL endpoint
* A word on Babel and ES6

## 1. Setup

### Install prerequisites

* NodeJS
* code editor like VSCode and
* Git
* Postman

### Clone the step 1 branch from this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/agartman/graphql-training.git -b step1-hello
```

or download and unzip from

```
https://github.com/agartman/graphql-training/archive/step1-hello.zip
```

## 2. Installation on command line

navigate to the root folder of the repository/package

```
npm install

npm start
```

## 3. Result

You should have a working GraphQL HTTP endpoint with a GraphiQL instance to test the endpoint.

Here's a picture of the end result, with example run on Postman to the running endpoint
